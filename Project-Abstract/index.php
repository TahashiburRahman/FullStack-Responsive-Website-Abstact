                <h4>Investment Strategy</h4>
                <p>Our investment strategy seeks to capitalize on markets where we <br> anticipate outsized growth and
                    associated risk-adjusted returns. <br> Based on demographic trends we have a deep conviction in the
                    <br> ongoing strength of multifamily, particularly in the Mountain West <br> and in emerging Tier 2,
                    business friendly markets. But we are equally <br> entrepreneurial and opportunistic, and are
                    prepared to seize the <br> moment where we find it, regardless of asset class or geography. <br>
                    Mixed-use projects requiring ground up development or significant <br>upgrades, particularly those
                    with a hospitality or residential <br> component, or both, are always in our sights.

                <h4>Three Times a Charm</h4>
                <h6>South Florida Three-Building Portfolio</h6>
                <div class="header7">Over a period of six years, Jason successfully created more than $200 million of
                    value <br>through the development process. He raised equity, managed debt and was actively <br>
                    engaged in all daily pre-development aspects for three south Florida luxury condominiums,<br> one of
                    which included a retail component. Together the projects encompassed 850,000 SF <br> and almost 400
                    units with a sellout value of $738 million. This success was achieved by <br> laying a good early
                    foundation – undertaking a thorough financial analysis, appropriately <br>structuring both debt and
                    equity for each of the properties, closing financing in each <br>instance and applying both project
                    level and asset management skills.</div>

                <h4>Long-Term Thinking and Roll-Your-Sleeves-Up Moxie</h4>
                <h6>Brooklyn Master Plan with Multifamily and Retail</h6>
                <div class="header7">Recognizing the long-term needs of New York City, Jason was involved with the
                    acquisition
                    of <br> several sites along the Gowanus Canal as the industrial neighborhood was undergoing a
                    significant<br> 82-block mixed-use rezoning. Ultimately 8,200 new housing units are projected within
                    15 years with<br> a significant number reserved as permanently affordable.<br><br> To uncover value,
                    he worked inside this rezoning framework leveraging a deep understanding of<br> public/private
                    partnerships and government processes to acquire the sites and shepherd them the<br> through New
                    York City’s extensive Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP). This public review<br> process is
                    not for the faint of heart, particularly when the land in question has the potential for<br> 1M GSF
                    and more than 700 units of housing along with supporting retail uses. His efforts, which<br>
                    included monitoring the site remediation, resulted in significant value add at disposition.</div>

                <h4>One Plus One Equals Three</h4>
                <h6>Central Park South Condominium</h6>
                <div class="header7">Over the course of almost a decade Jason was deeply engaged in the complex
                    assemblage of <br> one of New York’s most opulent properties. The resulting structure, artfully
                    transforms the <br>existing structure into the “old New York” residences and blends it in to a new
                    glass 1,400 foot <br>tall residential tower that reaches into the sky. The project, which reshaped
                    the Central Park<br> skyline, includes 60 ultra-luxury condominiums atop a five-story retail
                    podium.<br><br> This was a complex project to design, build and capitalize. It sat on a small lot
                    where it became<br> one of the slimmest towers in the world. Its $ 1billion complex capital
                    structure included a <br>variety of institutions providing a mixture of both equity and debt. The
                    estimated $1.7 billion<br> sellout will ultimately create a net profit of over $700 million, much of
                    which was predicated on<br> the economic analysis and valuation Jason provided early on to the joint
                    venture.</div>

                <h4>Creating Value from the Ground Up </h4>
                <h6>Long Island City Mixed-Use Luxury Rental and Retail</h6>
                <div class="">From the early stages of development through to refinancing and, ultimately, <br>
                    disposition, Jason created value for this $220 million project in a burgeoning Queens<br>
                    neighborhood. Intimately involved in all facets of development from the initial equity<br> raise to
                    managing the capital stack and closing the construction loan, he also<br> supervised design and
                    entitlements, marketing and lease up. With a decision to self-<br>perform construction, Jason built
                    an in-house team and performed on-site supervision,<br> including responsibility for all
                    subcontractors involved in erecting the 391 luxury rentals<br> with complementary retail space.
                    Overcoming financial challenges throughout the<br> process, he ultimately led the project to
                    stabilization and a disposition valued at over $300 million.</div>

                <h4>Expediting an Assemblage and Maximizing Profits</h4>
                <h6>Long Island City Mixed-Use Luxury Rental, Retail and Office</h6>
                <div class="header7">With the clock ticking, Jason moved expeditiously to assemble land and <br> air
                    rights and break ground on a landmark clocktower property, and an adjacent site owned by a
                    <br>municipal entity prior to the expiration of a significant tax incentive program. With just <br>
                    16 days to complete the transaction, Jason structured a unique deal to purchase air <br> rights,
                    create a combined developable site and conceive a public park to meet a <br>community benefit
                    requirement. The 837,000 buildable SF site could be zoned for up <br> to 800 residential units –
                    among the tallest buildings in the neighborhood. The quick <br>work on the $170 million project
                    resulted in a sale to a major NYC developer and a win/<br>win/win for seller, buyer and community
                    alike.

                        <p>Following a deep dive into the fundamentals of the market, we are developing
                            a $70M, 180-unit ground-up multifamily project in the Downtown district of South Salt Lake –
                            creating the intersection between Downtown Salt Lake City, Silicon Slopes, Sugar House and
                            Park City. In keeping with our investment strategy, we are attracted to the burgeoning urban
                            scene that is courting an engaged tech employee base. We anticipate outsized risk-adjusted
                            returns compared to Downtown projects. A Mid-Century Modern design aesthetic with strong
                            geometric lines creates the building’s exterior, artfully complementing and contrasting with
                            its Rocky Mountain backdrop. A distinctive porte cochere entrance sets a welcoming tone and
                            for the many distinguishing features and amenities of this lifestyle-focused project. A mix
                            of studio to 2BR units are designed to attract an upscale Gen Z audience with completion
                            expected in Q4 2024.</p>

                            District of Salt Lake City, our new development will be located adjacent to entrance and
                            exit ramps of I-15 as well as caddy-corner to the Trax stop. The city’s new Ballpark
                            District Master Plan has engendered significant interest in this neighborhood and our
                            property is ideally located to capitalize on this transformation. Our site, centrally
                            located to many Valley amenities, is also proximate to some of the neighborhood’s funkiest
                            breweries and restaurants. Our design embraces the authentic industrial vibe of the area’s
                            manufacturing history by reviving the tired existing greenery and expanding it along the
                            façade. Additionally, the façade recaptures a two-story parking structure and repurposes it
                            into a unique piece of art which then climbs upward to meet dark blue brick. The brick has
                            been selected to change color depending upon the angle of the sun – creating a dynamic
                            kaleidoscope of color, pattern and form as a distinguishing feature of the property.
                            Comprised of studio and 1BR units to attract a younger a demographic, the building is
                            expected to debut in Q3 2025.</p>
